Work Envelope,,"The set of all points which a manipulator can reach without intrusion. Sometimes the shape of the work space, and the position of the manipulator itself can restrict the work envelope."
Work Home Position,,"The Work Home Position is a reference point for manipulator operations. It prevents interference with peripheral device by ensuring that the manipulator is always within a set range as a precondition for operations such as starting the line. The manipulator can be moved to the set Work Home Position by operation from the programming pendant, or by signal input from an external device. When the manipulator is in the vicinity of the Work Home Position, the Work Home Position signal turns ON."
Work Piece,,"Any part which is being worked, refined or manufactured prior to its becoming a finished product."
Workspace,,The volume of space within which the robot can perform given tasks.
World Coordinates,,"A reference coordinate system in which the manipulator arm moves in linear motions along a set of Cartesian or rectangular axes in X, Y, and Z directions. The shape of the work envelope forms a rectangular figure. See Rectangular Coordinates."
World Model,,"A three dimensional representation of the robot's work environment, including objects and their position and orientation in this environment, which is stored in robot memory. As objects are sensed within the environment the robot's controller system continually updates the World Model. Robots use this World Model to aid in determining its actions in order to complete given tasks."
Wrist,,"A set of rotary joints between the arm and the robot end-effector that allow the end-effector to be oriented to the work-piece. In most cases the wrist can have degrees of freedom which enable it to grasp an object with roll, pitch, and yaw orientation. See Arm, End-effector, Roll, Pitch, Yaw and Work Piece."
Wrist [Secondary Axis],,"An interconnected set of links and powered joints between the arm and end- effector, which supports, positions and orientates the end effector. (ISO 8373)"
